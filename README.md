# The Smart Goal Planner

A dynamic, interactive financial goal management application built with React, HTML, CSS, and featuring a mock backend with JSON Server.

By David Chumo

## Description

This is a comprehensive, yet user-friendly, financial goal management application. It's designed to empower users to define, track, and manage multiple savings goals with ease. The application showcases modern frontend development concepts including React's component-based architecture, state management with Hooks, asynchronous data fetching, and dynamic UI updates. It leverages JSON Server to simulate a backend API, allowing users to perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their financial goals with persistence.

## Features

* **Multiple Savings Goals:** Create, update, and delete any number of financial goals. Each goal comes with a name, target amount, category, and a clear deadline.

* **Real-time Progress Tracking:** Visualize your savings journey with dynamic progress bars, showing the total amount saved against your target and the remaining balance.

* **Easy Deposits:** Seamlessly add funds to any of your active goals, instantly updating your progress.

* **Comprehensive Overview:** Get a birds-eye view of your financial health:

  * Total number of goals.

  * Aggregate savings across all goals.

  * Count of completed goals.

  * Time remaining until each goal's deadline.

  * **Smart Alerts:** Get warnings for goals nearing their deadline (within 30 days) and clear indicators for overdue goals.

* **Persistence:** All your goal data is securely stored and managed via a RESTful API. For the live site, this backend is hosted on Render.com. For local development, a `db.json` file simulated with `json-server` is used.

## How to Use

### Requirements

1. A computer with Node.js installed (for npm commands).

2. Access to the internet (for initial package downloads).

3. A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

4. A code editor (VS Code recommended).

5. Terminal/Command Line.

### Live Site

### Local Development

If you want to run the project locally, follow these steps:

#### Installation Process

* **Clone the repository:**

  ```bash
  git clone [https://github.com/kandadave/goal-planner](https://github.com/kandadave/goal-planner)
  cd goal-planner
  ```
  

  * **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and install the React app's dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install

    ```

  * **Install `json-server` (Globally):**
    If you haven't already, install `json-server` globally. This allows you to run it from any directory.

    ```bash
    npm install -g json-server

    ```

#### Setup `db.json`

Ensure you have a `db.json` file in the **root directory** of your `goal-planner` project. This file will serve as your local database. You can use the provided example data:

```json

  "goals": [
    {

    }
  ]
}
```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start `json-server` (Backend Simulation):**
    Open a **new terminal window** (separate from where you'll run the React app), navigate to your project's root directory, and run:

    ```bash
    json-server --watch db.json --port 3000

    ```

    You should see output indicating that `json-server` is serving resources, including `http://localhost:3000/goals`.

2.  **Start the React Development Server (Frontend):**
    In your **original terminal window** (or another new one), navigate to the project's root directory and run:

    ```bash
    npm start

    ```

    This will open the Smart Goal Planner in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Technologies Used

  * **React.js (ES6+):** For building the interactive user interface with a component-based architecture and managing application state using Hooks.
  * **HTML5:** For structuring the web content.
  * **CSS3:** For styling and creating the appealing, responsive layout.
  * **JSON Server:** A lightweight server used to create a fake REST API quickly, providing persistence for financial goals to the `db.json` file.
